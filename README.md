## Introduction

Developing feature-rich websites for multiple brands often involves significant time, resources, and technical expertise. With a white label application developers can create two or more websites with a single codebase. This approach not only saves time but also enhances scalability for businesses that may need to expand their online presence in the future.

A white label application is a pre-built software solution that can be rebranded and customized by businesses to suit their specific needs. If a company is owner of multiple brands it can create multiple websites with less money and way faster because the developers just need to code once because the code structure is basically the same for all websites. The downside of it is that if you have multiple websites they will have the same structure and the only difference between them are the texts, images and colors so the customization of those websites is more limited. The advantage of this kind of solution is that you need less developers, the codebase is easier to maintain compared to maintaining multiple websites with different codebases and this solution allow better scalability because if the company create or buy another brand you just need to add the texts, images and colors specific to that new brand to the code.

The idea behind this white-label application is to solve the problem of a company called Maze which wants a car selling and a motorcycle selling website. The company want a solution that doesn't involve many resources and a scalable solution because they may expand the Maze ecosystem in the future.

## How to Run Maze
